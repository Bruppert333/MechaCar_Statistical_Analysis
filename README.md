## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Deliverable_1](Deliverables/Deliverable_1.png).
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
I believe if I am looking at this model correctly, the coefficients that provided a non random amount would be the Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the slope is not zero because it is 8.77.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
No, how could it? There are a lot more things that go into the MPG factor than what is in this data. What about engine type? Tire size? This linear model can come close probably but there are more factors that go into it in my opinion.
